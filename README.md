# Data-Centre-Frontier
GovHack 2025 Project for the challenge, Data Centres: A Cornerstone of Australia's AI Future.



Data Centre Frontier is a planning platform that turns complex site due diligence into clear, defensible decisions. Users draw a prospective data centre footprint and receive an immediate viability score with full breakdowns across electrical infrastructure, terrestrial and submarine telecoms, environmental hazards, climate, population and land-use zoning, and geological/topographic constraints. Using AI models and auditable datasets, the software also forecasts power and water demand, operating costs, and resilience trade-offs, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons between sites and designs. Every score is explainable: users can inspect inputs, weights and assumptions, export reports, and share evidence with stakeholders. With Data Centre Frontier, governments and organisations can choose locations that are faster to permit, cheaper to run, and better for the grid and the environment.
